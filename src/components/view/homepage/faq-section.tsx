    question: "What do I stake in a battle?",
    answer:
      "Your LP NFT is your stake. If you win, you claim both LPs. If you lose, your LP goes to your opponent.",
  },

    question: "How are battles settled?",
    answer:
      "If one price range survives, that player wins. If both ranges fail or survive, the LP with the biggest gain wins.",

    question: "What if my LP value doesn’t match the opponent's?",
    answer:
      "Only LPs within a 0.5% value difference are matched. You’ll only see battles you can join.",

    answer:
      "Yes. All contracts are audited, funds are locked in escrow, and price data is sourced from secure oracles like Chainlink.",

    answer:
      "The MVP supports Uniswap V3 LP NFTs. More DEX support is coming soon.",
