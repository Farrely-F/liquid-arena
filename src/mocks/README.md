This folder contains mock data for the app. It is used to populate the app with sample data for development and testing purposes.

The data is organized into separate files for each type of data, such as users, tokens, and transactions. Each file contains an array of objects, where each object represents a single item of data.

The data is used by the app's API routes to return sample data when the app is run in development mode. This allows developers to test the app without having to create real data.

The data can also be used to populate the app with sample data for testing purposes. For example, the `users` file can be used to create sample users for testing the app's authentication and authorization features.

The data is not used in production, and is only used for development and testing purposes.
